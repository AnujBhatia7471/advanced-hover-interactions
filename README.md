# WebGL Mirror Distortion 🪞✨
WebGL Mirror Distortion is a creative visual experiment that simulates a dynamic mirror-like surface using WebGL and GLSL shaders. The project creates smooth distortion, ripple, and reflection effects that run in real time inside the browser.
This project is ideal for learning shader programming, creative coding, and advanced WebGL effects.

## 🚀 Live Demo
https://anujbhatia7471.github.io/advanced-hover-interactions/
## 🎯 Features
- Real-time mirror distortion effect
- Smooth animated ripple and wave patterns
- Fragment shader–based rendering
- High-performance GPU rendering via WebGL
- Responsive canvas (works on desktop & mobile)
- Clean and minimal code structure


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **WebGL**
- **GLSL (Vertex & Fragment Shaders)**
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML5 Canvas**
- **CSS**

## 🧠 How It Works
- A full-screen WebGL canvas is created.
- The vertex shader handles geometry positioning.
- The fragment shader applies:
  - UV distortion
  - Time-based sine waves
  - Reflection-style warping
- Uniforms like `time` and `resolution` are updated on every frame to animate the distortion effect.

## 📦 Installation & Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AnujBhatia7471/advanced-hover-interactions.git
2️⃣ Open the project
Simply open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

⚠️ For local shader loading, use a local server:
npx serve
📱 Compatibility
✔ Desktop browsers
✔ Mobile browsers
✔ Touch devices (auto-adapted)
❌ Very old browsers without WebGL support

✨ Customization Ideas
Add mouse or touch interaction
Adjust distortion intensity
Apply image or video textures
Combine with post-processing effects
Convert into a portfolio background animation
